      "almost worse than it being the government’s fault\n",

      "positively stamping up and down. “Trees uprooted,\n",

      "losing Amelia Bones.”\n",
      "“Losing who?”\n",
      "“Amelia Bones. Head of the Department of Magical\n",
      "Law Enforcement. We think He-Who-Must-Not-Be Named may have murdered her in person, because\n",

      "wasn’t she? We, on the other hand, know exactly who\n",
      "did it, not that that gets us any further toward\n",
      "catching him. And then there was Emmeline Vance,\n",
      "maybe you didn’t hear about that one —”\n",
      "“Oh yes I did!” said the Prime Minister. “It happened\n",
      "just around the corner from here, as a matter of fact.\n",

      "swarming all over the place, attacking people left,\n",
      "right, and center. …”\n",
      "Once upon a happier time this sentence would have\n",
      "been unintelligible to the Prime Minister, but he was\n",
      "wiser now.\n",
      "“I thought dementors guard the prisoners in\n",
      "Azkaban,” he said cautiously.\n",
      "“They did,” said Fudge wearily. “But not anymore.\n",
      "They’ve deserted the prison and joined He-Who-Must Not-Be-Named. I won’t pretend that wasn’t a blow.”\n",
      "“But,” said the Prime Minister, with a sense of\n",
      "dawning horror, “didn’t you tell me they’re the\n",
      "creatures that drain hope and happiness out of\n",
      "people?”\n",
      "“That’s right. And they’re breeding. That’s what’s\n",
      "causing all this mist.”\n",
      "The Prime Minister sank, weak-kneed, into the\n",
      "nearest chair. The idea of invisible creatures swooping\n",
      "through the towns and countryside, spreading\n",
      "despair and hopelessness in his voters, made him feel\n",
      "quite faint.“Now see here, Fudge — you’ve got to do something!\n",
      "It’s your responsibility as Minister of Magic!”\n",
      "“My dear Prime Minister, you can’t honestly think I’m\n",
      "still Minister of Magic after all this? I was sacked\n",
      "three days ago! The whole Wizarding community has\n",
      "been screaming for my resignation for a fortnight. I’ve\n",
      "never known them so united in my whole term of\n",
      "office!” said Fudge, with a brave attempt at a smile.\n",
      "The Prime Minister was momentarily lost for words.\n",
      "Despite his indignation at the position into which he\n",
      "had been placed, he still rather felt for the shrunken looking man sitting opposite him.\n",
      "“I’m very sorry,” he said finally. “If there’s anything I\n",
      "can do?”“It’s very kind of you, Prime Minister, but there is\n",
      "nothing. I was sent here tonight to bring you up to\n",
      "date on recent events and to introduce you to my\n",
      "successor. I rather thought he’d be here by now, but of course, he’s very\n",
      "busy at the moment, with so\n",
      "much going on.”\n",
      "Fudge looked around at the portrait of the ugly little\n",
      "man wearing the long curly silver wig, who was\n",
      "digging in his ear with the point of a quill. Catching\n",
      "Fudge’s eye, the portrait said, “He’ll be here in a\n",
      "moment, he’s just finishing a letter to Dumbledore.”\n",
      "“I wish him luck,” said Fudge, sounding bitter for the\n",
      "first time. “I’ve been writing to Dumbledore twice a\n",
      "day for the past fortnight, but he won’t budge. If he’d\n",
      "just been prepared to persuade the boy, I might still\n",
      "be … Well, maybe Scrimgeour will have more\n",
      "success.”\n",
      "Fudge subsided into what was clearly an aggrieved\n",
      "silence, but it was broken almost immediately by the\n",
      "portrait, which suddenly spoke in its crisp, official\n",
      "voice.\n",
      "“To the Prime Minister of Muggles. Requesting a\n",
      "meeting. Urgent. Kindly respond immediately. Rufus\n",
      "Scrimgeour, Minister of Magic.”\n",
      "“Yes, yes, fine,” said the Prime Minister distractedly,\n",
      "and he barely flinched as the flames in the grate\n",
      "turned emerald green again, rose up, and revealed a\n",
      "second spinning wizard in their heart, disgorging him\n",
      "moments later onto the antique rug.\n",
      "Fudge got to his feet and, after a moment’s hesitation,\n",
      "the Prime Minister did the same, watching the new\n",
      "arrival straighten up, dust down his long black robes,\n",
      "and look around.\n",
      "The Prime Minister’s first, foolish thought was that\n",
      "Rufus Scrimgeour looked rather like an old lion.\n",
      "There were streaks of gray in his mane of tawny hair and his bushy\n",
      "eyebrows; he had keen yellowish eyes\n",
      "behind a pair of wire-rimmed spectacles and a certain\n",
      "rangy, loping grace even though he walked with a\n",
      "slight limp. There was an immediate impression of\n",
      "shrewdness and toughness; the Prime Minister\n",
      "thought he understood why the Wizarding community\n",
      "preferred Scrimgeour to Fudge as a leader in these\n",
      "dangerous times.\n",
      "“How do you do?” said the Prime Minister politely,\n",
      "holding out his hand.\n",
      "Scrimgeour grasped it briefly, his eyes scanning the\n",
      "room, then pulled out a wand from under his robes.\n",
      "“Fudge told you everything?” he asked, striding over\n",
      "to the door and tapping the keyhole with his wand.\n",
      "The Prime Minister heard the lock click.\n",
      "“Er — yes,” said the Prime Minister. “And if you don’t\n",
      "mind, I’d rather that door remained unlocked.”\n",
      "“I’d rather not be interrupted,” said Scrimgeour\n",
      "shortly, “or watched,” he added, pointing his wand at\n",
      "the windows, so that the curtains swept across them.\n",
      "“Right, well, I’m a busy man, so let’s get down to\n",
      "business. First of all, we need to discuss your\n",
      "security.”The Prime Minister drew himself up to his fullest\n",
      "height and replied, “I am perfectly happy with the\n",
      "security I’ve already got, thank you very —”\n",
      "“Well, we’re not,” Scrimgeour cut in. “It’ll be a poor\n",

      "your outer office —”\n",
      "“I’m not getting rid of Kingsley Shacklebolt, if that’s what you’re\n",
      "suggesting!” said the Prime Minister\n",
      "hotly. “He’s highly efficient, gets through twice the\n",
      "work the rest of them —”\n",
      "“That’s because he’s a wizard,” said Scrimgeour,\n",
      "without a flicker of a smile. “A highly trained Auror,\n",
      "who has been assigned to you for your protection.”\n",
      "“Now, wait a moment!” declared the Prime Minister.\n",

      "“What about him?” asked the Prime Minister.\n",
      "“He has clearly reacted to a poorly performed\n",

      "“You don’t really want her around forever?” Ginny\n",

      "“How’s she going to manage that?” asked Harry.\n",
      "“She keeps trying to get Tonks round for dinner. I\n",

      "hope he does, I’d much rather have her in the family.”\n",
      "“Yeah, that’ll work,” said Ron sarcastically. “Listen,\n",
      "no bloke in his right mind’s going to fancy Tonks\n",
      "when Fleur’s around. I mean, Tonks is okay-looking\n",
      "when she isn’t doing stupid things to her hair and her\n",
      "nose, but —”\n",
      "“She’s a damn sight nicer than Phlegm, ’’ said Ginny\n",
      "“And she’s more intelligent, she’s an Auror!” said\n",
      "Hermione from the corner.\n",
      "“Fleur’s not stupid, she was good enough to enter the\n",
      "Triwizard Tournament,” said Harry.\n",
      "“Not you as well!” said Hermione bitterly.\n",
      "“I suppose you like the way Phlegm says ‘’Arry,’ do\n",
      "you?” asked Ginny scornfully.\n",
      "“No,” said Harry, wishing he hadn’t spoken, “I was\n",
      "just saying, Phlegm — I mean, Fleur —”\n",
      "“I’d much rather have Tonks in the family,” said\n",
      "Ginny. “At least she’s a laugh.”\n",
      "“She hasn’t been much of a laugh lately,” said Ron.\n",
      "“Every time I’ve seen her she’s looked more like\n",
      "Moaning Myrtle.”\n",
      "“That’s not fair,” snapped Hermione. “She still hasn’t\n",
      "got over what happened … you know … I mean, he\n",
      "was her cousin!”\n",
      "Harry’s heart sank. They had arrived at Sirius. He\n",
      "picked up a fork and began shoveling scrambled eggs\n",
      "into his mouth, hoping to deflect any invitation to join\n",
      "in this part of the conversation.\n",
      "“Tonks and Sirius barely knew each other!” said Ron.\n",
      "“Sirius was in Azkaban half her life and before that\n",
      "their families never met —”\n",
      "“That’s not the point,” said Hermione. “She thinks it\n",
      "was her fault he died!”\n",
      "“How does she work that one out?” asked Harry, in\n",
      "spite of himself.\n",
      "“Well, she was fighting Bellatrix Lestrange, wasn’t\n",
      "she? I think she feels that if only she had finished her\n",
      "off, Bellatrix couldn’t have killed Sirius.”\n",
      "“That’s stupid,” said Ron.\n",
      "“It’s survivor’s guilt,” said Hermione. “I know Lupin’s tried to talk her\n",
      "round, but she’s still really down.\n",
      "She’s actually having trouble with her\n",
      "Metamorphosing!”\n",
      "“With her — ?”\n",
      "“She can’t change her appearance like she used to,”\n",
      "explained Hermione. “I think her powers must have\n",
      "been affected by shock, or something.”\n",
      "“I didn’t know that could happen,” said Harry.\n",
      "“Nor did I,” said Hermione, “but I suppose if you’re\n",
      "really depressed …”\n",
      "The door opened again and Mrs. Weasley popped her\n",
      "head in. “Ginny,” she whispered, “come downstairs\n",
      "and help me with the lunch.”\n",
      "“I’m talking to this lot!” said Ginny, outraged.\n",
      "“Now!” said Mrs. Weasley, and withdrew.\n",
      "“She only wants me there so she doesn’t have to be\n",
      "alone with Phlegm!” said Ginny crossly. She swung\n",
      "her long red hair around in a very good imitation of\n",
      "Fleur and pranced across the room with her arms\n",
      "held aloft like a ballerina.\n",
      "“You lot had better come down quickly too,” she said\n",
      "as she left.\n",
      "Harry took advantage of the temporary silence to eat\n",
      "more breakfast. Hermione was peering into Fred and\n",
      "George’s boxes, though every now and then she cast\n",
      "sideways looks at Harry. Ron, who was now helping\n",
      "himself to Harry’s toast, was still gazing dreamily at\n",
      "the door.\n",
      "“What’s this?” Hermione asked eventually, holding up what looked like a\n",
      "small telescope.\n",
      "“Dunno,” said Ron, “but if Fred and George’ve left it\n",
      "here, it’s probably not ready for the joke shop yet, so\n",
      "be careful.”\n",
      "“Your mum said the shop’s going well,” said Harry.\n",
      "“Said Fred and George have got a real flair for\n",
      "business.”\n",
      "“That’s an understatement,” said Ron. “They’re raking\n",
      "in the Galleons! I can’t wait to see the place, we\n",
      "haven’t been to Diagon Alley yet, because Mum says\n",
      "Dad’s got to be there for extra security and he’s been\n",
      "really busy at work, but it sounds excellent.”\n",
      "“And what about Percy?” asked Harry; the third\u0002eldest Weasley brother had fallen out with the rest of\n",
      "the family. “Is he talking to your mum and dad\n",
      "again?”\n",
      "“Nope,” said Ron.\n",
      "“But he knows your dad was right all along now\n",
      "about Voldemort being back —”\n",
      "“Dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive\n",
      "others for being wrong than being right,” said\n",
      "Hermione. “I heard him telling your mum, Ron.”\n",
      "“Sounds like the sort of mental thing Dumbledore\n",
      "would say,” said Ron.\n",
      "“He’s going to be giving me private lessons this year,”\n",
      "said Harry conversationally.\n",
      "Ron choked on his bit of toast, and Hermione gasped.\n",
      "“You kept that quiet!” said Ron.\n",
      "“I only just remembered,” said Harry honestly. “He\n",
      "told me last night in your broom shed.”\n",
      "“Blimey … private lessons with Dumbledore!” said\n",
      "Ron, looking impressed. “I wonder why he’s … ?”\n",
      "His voice tailed away. Harry saw him and Hermione\n",
      "exchange looks. Harry laid down his knife and fork,\n",
      "his heart beating rather fast considering that all he\n",
      "was doing was sitting in bed. Dumbledore had said to\n",
      "do it. … Why not now? He fixed his eyes on his fork,\n",
      "which was gleaming in the sunlight streaming into his\n",
      "lap, and said, “I don’t know exactly why he’s going to\n",
      "be giving me lessons, but I think it must be because\n",
      "of the prophecy.”\n",
      "Neither Ron nor Hermione spoke. Harry had the\n",
      "impression that both had frozen. He continued, still\n",
      "speaking to his fork, “You know, the one they were\n",
      "trying to steal at the Ministry.”\n",
      "“Nobody knows what it said, though,” said Hermione\n",
      "quickly. “It got smashed.”\n",
      "“Although the Prophet says —” began Ron, but\n",
      "Hermione said, “Shh!”\n",
      "“The Prophet’s got it right,” said Harry, looking up at\n",
      "them both with a great effort: Hermione seemed\n",
      "frightened and Ron amazed. “That glass ball that\n",
      "smashed wasn’t the only record of the prophecy. I\n",
      "heard the whole thing in Dumbledore’s office, he was\n",
      "the one the prophecy was made to, so he could tell\n",
      "me. From what it said,” Harry took a deep breath, “it\n",
      "looks like I’m the one who’s got to finish off\n",
      "Voldemort. … At least, it said neither of us could live\n",
      "while the other survives.” \n",
      "The three of them gazed at one another in silence for a moment. Then there\n",
      "was a loud bang and Hermione\n",
      "vanished behind a puff of black smoke.\n",
      "“Hermione!” shouted Harry and Ron; the breakfast\n",
      "tray slid to the floor with a crash.\n",
      "Hermione emerged, coughing, out of the smoke,\n",
      "clutching the telescope and sporting a brilliantly\n",
      "purple black eye.\n",
      "“I squeezed it and it — it punched me!” she gasped.\n",
      "And sure enough, they now saw a tiny fist on a long\n",
      "spring protruding from the end of the telescope.\n",
      "“Don’t worry,” said Ron, who was plainly trying not to\n",
      "laugh, “Mum’ll fix that, she’s good at healing minor\n",
      "injuries —”\n",
      "“Oh well, never mind that now!” said Hermione\n",

      "“We wondered, after we got back from the Ministry …\n",
      "Obviously, we didn’t want to say anything to you, but\n",
      "from what Lucius Malfoy said about the prophecy,\n",
      "how it was about you and Voldemort, well, we\n",
